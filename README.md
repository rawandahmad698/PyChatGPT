### Tuesday, December 6, 2022 (Code is tested, working and updated 💯)
I got reports of OpenAI changing their API method, nothing is changed, they just added some extra headers (Check out ./Classes/chat.py)

# PyChatGPT
*If you want me to maintain this repo, please star ⭐️*


I have been looking for a way to interact with the new Chat GPT API, but most of the sources here on GitHub 
require you to have a Chromium instance running in the background. or by using the Web Inspector to grab Access Token manually.

No more. I have been able to reverse engineer the API and use a TLS client to mimic a real user, allowing the script to login without setting off any bot detection techniques by Auth0

Basically, the script logs in on your behalf, using a TLS client, then grabs the Access Token. It's pretty fast.

### Features
- [x] Automatically login without involving a browser
- [x] Automatically grab Access Token
- [x] Get around the login captcha (If you try to log in subsequently, you will be prompted to solve a captcha)
- [x] Saves the access token to a file, so you don't have to log in again
- [x] Automatically refreshes the access token when it expires
- [x] Uses colorama to colorize the output, because why not?
- [x] HTTP API serving

### Shall we get started?
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `config.json` and enter your email and password.
4. Run `main.py` and let the script do the rest.  
5. *[optional]* To enable HTTP-API support:
- Install uvicorn by running `pip install "uvicorn[standard]"`;
- Start by running: `nohup uvicorn webapi:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload > log.txt 2>&1 &`. ;
- Then, access by `GET` method at `http://host:port/{prompt}`. 

### Other notes
If the token creation process is failing, on `main.py` on line 40
1. Try to use a proxy (I recommend using this always)
```python
Auth.OpenAIAuth(email_address=email, password=password, use_proxy=True, proxy="http://127.0.0.0:8080")
```
2. Don't try to log in too fast. At least wait 10 minutes if you're being rate limited
3. If you're still having issues, try to use a VPN. On a VPN, the script should work fine
### What's next?
I'm planning to add a few more features, such as:
- [ ] A GUI
- [ ] A way to save the conversation
- [ ] Better error handling

2. The Script creating a token for you.

### The whole process
First, I'd like to tell you that "just making http" requests is not going to be enough, Auth0 is smart, each process is guarded by a 
`state` token, which is a JWT token. This token is used to prevent CSRF attacks, and it's also used to prevent bots from logging in.
If you look at the `auth.py` file, there are over nine functions, each one of them is responsible for a different task, and they all
work together to create a token for you. `allow-redirects` played a huge role in this, as it allowed to navigate through the login process

I work at MeshMonitors.io, We make amazing tools (Check it out yo!). I decided not to spend too much time on this, but here we are, I have been able to reverse engineer the API and use a TLS client to mimic a real user, allowing the script to login without setting off any bot detection techniques by Auth0

### Why did I do this?
No one has been able to do this, and I wanted to see if I could.
